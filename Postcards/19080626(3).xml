		<text>June 26 1908 1. PM. I am now on the road. You see by this picture that a tie pin would come in very handy. I wanted to mail this to you from columbus but they were not dry enough. I paid .25 for three & waited 10 minutes. I will not get to mail this until I get to Pittsburg. Excuse this writing for we are heading along at about 60 miles per hour.</text>
