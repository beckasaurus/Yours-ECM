		<text>Feb. 26 1908. Your card and letter came this morning. I was agreeably surprised to receive them too. I have much to tell you when I write again if I can think about it when I sit down to write. This shows the large auditorium where many of my exams and held. Here is where they hold the grad. exercises. At x on the left is where my seat was last year! To be sure if you do no have time to write a letter a card will do. I will look for a note or card any how. Just send Miss Ellis a postal</text>
