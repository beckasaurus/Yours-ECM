		<text>Baltimore O. Sept 20, 1906. [OVNE] leave here at 1:11PM on my trip to school. I received my pictures yesterday but your smiling face was not found in therein. Did you get any of mine? You did not get the kind that I intended if you did. We can see about that when I reach my destination.</text>
