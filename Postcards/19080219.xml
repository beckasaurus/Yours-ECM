		<text>Wed, Feb 19 1908. 4 P.M. Have just come from an examination. Did fairly well on it I think. I have one on Saturday also. The weather here is something dreadful. It snowed hard all day and has now turned to sleet and rain. I should have sent you this card last year but it will do just the same any way. I will look for a letter on Saturday.</text>
